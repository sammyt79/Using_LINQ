# Using_LINQ

.NET2 week4

This was my week 4 individual assignment for .NET2 C#.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Design, implement, test, and debug a C# program to demonstrate the use of LINQ.  Using the dice simulation scenario in week 1, change the program such that the program could run at least 2 sequences of 100 throws, and generate two lists containing the dice total of each throw.
